**How to use:**
1)	Select a sorting algorithm
2)	Enter number of bars/array size to visualize (sorting speed will adjust accordingly)
3)	Click start - a set of bars with randomly generated heights will appear and sorting will commence based on the selected sorting algorithm
4)	Once sorting has finished, a restart button appears that leads back to the main selection screen
