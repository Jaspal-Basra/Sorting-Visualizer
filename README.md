# Sorting Visualizer
A visualization tool for sorting algorithms made in C++ using the SFML library.  

This application is capable of visualizing selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

**How to use:**
1)	Select a sorting algorithm
2)	Enter number of bars/array size to visualize (sorting speed will adjust accordingly)
3)	Click start - a set of bars with randomly generated heights will appear and sorting will commence based on the selected sorting algorithm
4)	Once sorting has finished, a restart button appears that leads back to the main selection screen

Press Esc to exit the app at any time.

## Building

The project can be built using Visual Studio. The Visual Studio solution (.sln) and project files (.vcxproj, .filters) and the pre-built SFML binaries are included in the repository.
